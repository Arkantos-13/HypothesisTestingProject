All the code that I wrote can be found in the Assignmen*.ipynb files

This repo also contains the Jupyter notebook for my [Hypothesis Testing project][3] in which I coded a t-test to determine if university towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions using data obtained from the Zillow research data site, Wikipedia and the US Department of Commerce. Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy

<i>Skills obtained</i>:
- [learnt data cleaning and processing by doing becoming with pandas][1]
- [learnt how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates][2]
- [Engaged in a real-world data cleaning activity and found evidence for a given hypothesis by completing a project that tested my knowledge of cleaning, merging, manipulating, and test for significance in data][3]
